# Eggdude in Elm

Remake of a game I made when I was still at school as an excuse to experiment with the seemingly very impressive [Elm language](http://elm-lang.org/).

Currently in progress.

The [original Eggdude](https://github.com/dancras/eggdude-darkbasic) was a remake of the Commodore 64 game Kwik Snax written in DarkBASIC.
